  As a beginner Node.js backend developer, you dont need to know everything about AWS, microservices, Docker, data sharding, replication, building for scale, Nginx, Kafka, and system design. It's important to focus on the fundamentals first before expanding your knowledge base. 

Here are some key areas to focus on:

1. **Node.js**: Understand how Node.js works, be familiar with the Node.js API, and know how to develop APIs. You should understand the asynchronous nature of Node.js, promises, and callbacks. This is because Node.js is event-driven and asynchronous, which is crucial for building scalable network applications [Source 3](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/8-essential-skills-node-web-developers), [Source 8](https://refine.dev/blog/node-js-developer-skills/).

2. **Web Application Frameworks**: Get familiar with Express.js, which is a popular framework for Node.js. It's used to build web applications and APIs [Source 3](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/8-essential-skills-node-web-developers).

3. **Front-End Technologies**: Even though you are a backend developer, understanding front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be beneficial. This will make the occasional switch to the front-end easier [Source 3](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/8-essential-skills-node-web-developers).

4. **Databases**: You should know how to interact with databases and understand how to design database schemas. This is important because data is a crucial part of any application [Source 3](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/8-essential-skills-node-web-developers), [Source 8](https://refine.dev/blog/node-js-developer-skills/).

5. **Version Control Tools and Package Management**: Git is a version control tool that you should be familiar with. Node.js also has a package manager called npm, which you should understand [Source 8](https://refine.dev/blog/node-js-developer-skills/).

6. **Problem Solving**: As a developer, you'll be solving problems all the time. So, it's important to develop your problem-solving skills. This includes understanding how to debug code, handle errors, and come up with efficient solutions [Source 7](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/backend-developer-skills/).

7. **Understanding of HTTP and REST**: You should understand how HTTP works and how to build RESTful APIs. This is because most web applications communicate with the server using HTTP and REST [Source 7](https://www.interviewbit.com/blog/backend-developer-skills/).

8. **Testing**: Learn how to write unit tests for your code. This is important for ensuring that your code works as expected and for making it easier to refactor and maintain your code [Source 6](https://dev.to/piperymary/checklist-for-a-skilled-node-js-developer-3h89).

Once you're comfortable with these areas, you can start exploring more advanced topics like AWS, microservices, Docker, data sharding, replication, building for scale, Nginx, Kafka, and system design. Remember, it's okay to not know everything. You can always learn more as you gain more experience.
