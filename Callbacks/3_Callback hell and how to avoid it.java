**Callback Hell:**

Callback Hell, also known as the "Pyramid of Doom," refers to the situation in which multiple nested callbacks create code that is difficult to read and maintain. This often occurs when dealing with asynchronous operations, such as reading files or making API requests, leading to a deep indentation level that makes the code hard to follow.

**How it Occurs:**

When you have a series of asynchronous operations that depend on each other, you might end up with deeply nested callbacks. For example, if operation B depends on the result of operation A, and operation C depends on the result of B, you can quickly end up with a pyramid of callbacks.

**Preventing Callback Hell:**

1. **Use Promises:** Promises are a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations. They allow you to chain operations and handle errors more effectively.

2. **Async/Await:** Async/await is a syntax built on top of promises, providing a more concise and synchronous-looking way to write asynchronous code.

**Comparing Callback and Async/Await:**

```javascript
// Callback Hell
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);

  // Nested operation
  someAsyncOperation(data, (err, result) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(result);

    // More nested operations...
  });
});
```

```javascript
// Using Async/Await
const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFile() {
  try {
    const data = await fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8');
    console.log(data);

    // Async operation using await
    const result = await someAsyncOperation(data);
    console.log(result);

    // More operations...
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

readFile();
```

**Differences:**

1. **Readability:** The Async/Await version is generally considered more readable and easier to understand, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.

2. **Error Handling:** Async/Await allows you to use a try-catch block for error handling, making it more straightforward compared to checking errors in each callback.

3. **Synchronous-Looking Code:** Async/Await provides a syntax that looks more synchronous, making it easier for developers familiar with synchronous code to transition to asynchronous programming.

4. **Chaining:** Async/Await simplifies chaining asynchronous operations without deep nesting.

In summary, while both examples achieve the same goal, the Async/Await version is more modern, readable, and easier to maintain, making it a preferred choice in modern JavaScript development.
