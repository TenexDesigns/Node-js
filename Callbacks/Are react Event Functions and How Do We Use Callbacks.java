In React, events are indeed functions that receive callbacks and other parameters. They are used to handle user interactions such as clicks, form submissions, and other user interactions.

When you define an event handler in React, you're essentially creating a function that will be called when the event occurs. This function is often referred to as a callback function because it's a function that's passed as an argument to another function (the event handler).

Here's an example of a button click event in React:

```jsx
function MyComponent() {
 const handleClick = () => {
   console.log('Button clicked!');
 };

 return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;
}
```

In this example, `handleClick` is a callback function that's passed to the `onClick` event handler. When the button is clicked, the `handleClick` function is called, and "Button clicked!" is logged to the console.

You don't need to use parentheses when passing the callback function to the event handler. You're passing the function itself, not the result of calling the function. If you used parentheses, you would be calling the function immediately when the component renders, not when the event occurs.

So, in the context of React, events are functions that receive callbacks and other parameters, and you don't need to use parentheses to invoke these functions. You just pass the function itself to the event handler.
