In npm, there are two types of packages: local packages and global packages.
Lets explore the differences between them, how they are installed and uninstalled, and some additional information:

Local Packages:

Local packages are specific to a particular project and are installed in the projects directory.
They are listed as dependencies in the projects package.json file.
Local packages are managed by npm within the node_modules directory of the project.
To install a local package, use the following command within your projects directory:

npm install <package-name>
This command installs the package locally and adds it as a dependency in the package.json file.
To uninstall a local package, use the following command within your projects directory:

npm uninstall <package-name>
This command removes the package from the node_modules directory and updates the package.json file accordingly.
Global Packages:

Global packages are installed system-wide and can be accessed by any project on your machine.
They are typically used for command-line tools or utilities that you want to access from any project or terminal session.
Global packages are not listed in the projects package.json file.
To install a global package, use the following command:

npm install -g <package-name>
This command installs the package globally, making it available in your systems PATH.
To uninstall a global package, use the following command:

npm uninstall -g <package-name>
This command removes the package from the global installation.
Node Modules Folder:

The node_modules folder is where npm installs local packages and their dependencies.
For local packages, it resides within your projects directory.
The node_modules folder is automatically created when you install packages using npm.
It acts as a local repository for all the packages required by your project.
It is recommended to include the node_modules folder in your .gitignore file to prevent it from being committed to version control.
Managing Dependencies:

Local packages usually have their dependencies listed in the package.json file.
When you run npm install in your project, npm reads the package.json file and installs all 
the listed dependencies in the node_modules folder.
The package-lock.json file helps ensure consistent installations by storing the exact versions
of all packages and their dependencies.
Additional Packages:

Besides local and global packages, there are also development dependencies (devDependencies) and
peer dependencies (peerDependencies) that can be specified in the package.json file.
Development dependencies are packages required only during development and testing, not in production.
Peer dependencies are packages that your package requires its consumers to install.
When working with npm packages, it is generally recommended to install them locally within your project
unless you specifically require them to be globally accessible. Local packages provide better 
isolation between projects and ensure that each project has its own set of dependencies.

Remember to regularly update your dependencies, both local and global, to benefit from bug fixes,
new features, and security patches. However, exercise caution when upgrading packages, especially major versions, 
as they may introduce breaking changes. Always review the release notes and documentation of the package before performing updates.

Local and global packages in npm refer to the scope of the packages installed in your project and system-wide, respectively.

Local Packages

Local packages are installed in the node_modules folder of your project directory.
They are listed as keys in the dependencies, devDependencies, and optionalDependencies sections of
the package.json file codeforgeek.com.

To install a local package, run the following command in your project directory:

npm install <package_name>
To uninstall a local package, use the npm uninstall command:

npm uninstall <package_name>
If the package has a scope, you can add the scope before the package name:

npm uninstall <@scope/package_name>
Global Packages

Global packages are installed at a system-wide location, independent of the project directory codeforgeek.com.

To install a global package, use the -g flag with the npm install command:

npm install -g <package_name>
To uninstall a global package, use the -g flag with the npm uninstall command:

npm uninstall -g <package_name>
To list all globally installed packages, use the npm list -g command:

npm list -g
Uninstalling Dev Dependencies

To uninstall a dev dependency, use the -D or --save-dev flag with the npm uninstall command:

npm uninstall -D <package_name>
This will remove the package from the devDependencies section of your package.json file flaviocopes.com.

In summary, local packages are installed in the node_modules folder of your project, while global packages are
installed system-wide. To install and uninstall packages, use the npm install and
npm uninstall commands with the appropriate flags, depending on whether the package is a local or global package.
