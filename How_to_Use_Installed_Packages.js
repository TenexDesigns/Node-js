Any package we install is basicaly a module or file in node js, So we can use

const anyname = reuire("pagahe-name")


e.g
const uppercase = require("upercase").uppercse


console.log(uppercase('George Gacau'))

o use an installed package in your Node.js project, you can simply require the package in your JavaScript file and then use its
exported functions or objects. Heres a step-by-step guide:

Install the package using npm:
npm install <package_name>
In your JavaScript file, use the require function to import the package:
const packageName = require('<package_name>');
Use the package's exported functions or objects as needed:
// Example using the 'express' package
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
For example, lets say you want to use the express package in your project. First, install the package:

npm install express
Next, in your JavaScript file, you can use the express package as follows:

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
In this example, we imported the express package using the require function, created an app instance,
  defined a route for the root path (/), and started the server on port 3000.

If youre using a scoped package, include the scope wherever you use the package name docs.npmjs.com:

const packageName = require('@scope/<package_name>');
In summary, to use an installed npm package in your project, you need to import the package using the require function,
  and then use its exported functions or objects as needed.

Once you have installed packages using npm, you can use them in your files by requiring or importing them.
Heres how you can use installed packages in your file:

CommonJS Modules (Node.js):
In Node.js or environments that support CommonJS modules, you can use the require() function to import installed packages.


// Importing a package
const packageName = require('package-name');

// Using the package
packageName.methodName();
Replace 'package-name' with the actual name of the package you want to import.
You can then access the packags methods, classes, or variables using the packageName variable.

ES Modules (Browsers or Modern JavaScript):
In modern JavaScript or browser environments that support ES modules, you can use the import statement to import installed packages.


// Importing a package
import packageName from 'package-name';

// Using the package
packageName.methodName();
Again, replace 'package-name' with the name of the package you want to import. You can then access
the packages functionality using the packageName variable.

Note: To use ES modules in Node.js, you need to use the .mjs file extension and run your script
with the --experimental-modules flag, or configure your project to use ES modules by
updating the package.json file and setting "type": "module".

Global Packages:
Some packages may be installed globally, which means they are accessible across different projects and files.
Global packages can be used directly in your files without the need for importing or requiring. 
For example, if you have a global package that provides a command-line interface (CLI), you can use its commands 
in the terminal or command prompt.


$ package-name command
Replace 'package-name' with the name of the global package you want to use, 
  followed by the appropriate command or options.

Remember to refer to the packags documentation or README file for specific instructions on how to use its 
features and functions. It may provide examples and usage guidelines to help you utilize the package effectively in your files.

To use installed packages in a file, you can use the require() function. The require() function takes the name of the package as its argument and returns a reference to the package object. For example, to use the express package, you would use the following code:

Code snippet
const express = require('express');
Use code with caution. Learn more
Once you have a reference to the package object, you can use the methods and properties of the object to access the functionality of the package. For example, to create an express application, you would use the following code:

Code snippet
const app = express();
Use code with caution. Learn more
You can also use the require() function to import specific functions or classes from a package. For example, to import the app function from the express package, you would use the following code:

Code snippet
const app = require('express').app;
Use code with caution. Learn more
Once you have imported a function or class, you can use it like any other function or class. For example, to create an express application and listen on port 3000, you would use the following code:

Code snippet
const app = require('express').app;
app.listen(3000);
Use code with caution. Learn more
By following these steps, you can use installed packages in your code.

Here are some additional tips for using installed packages:

Only use packages that you need.
Avoid using packages that are not well-maintained.
Read the documentation for the packages that you use.
Test your code thoroughly before using it in production.
By following these tips, you can ensure that you are using installed packages safely and effectively.
