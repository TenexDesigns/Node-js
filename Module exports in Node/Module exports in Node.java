There are three main ways to export functions in Node.js modules:

* **Using `module.exports`:** This is the most common and recommended way to export functions. It allows you to export multiple functions in a single object. For example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  add: function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  },
  subtract: function(a, b) {
    return a - b;
  }
};
```

* **Using `exports`:** This is an older way to export functions, and it is not as commonly used anymore. It can be confusing because it can also be used to access the exports object within the module. For example:

```javascript
exports.add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

exports.subtract = function(a, b) {
  return a - b;
};
```

* **Using individual exports statements:** This is the least common way to export functions, and it is not recommended. It can be difficult to keep track of which functions have been exported, and it can make the code more difficult to read. For example:

```javascript
module.exports.add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

module.exports.subtract = function(a, b) {
  return a - b;
};
```

In general, it is best to use `module.exports` to export functions in Node.js modules. This is the most common and recommended way to do it, and it is the most consistent with the way that other modules are exported.

Here is a table summarizing the three methods:

| Method | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|---|---|---|
| `module.exports` | Common, recommended, consistent with other modules | None |
| `exports` | Older, less common, can be confusing | Difficult to keep track of which functions have been exported |
| Individual exports statements | Least common, not recommended, makes the code more difficult to read | Difficult to keep track of which functions have been exported |

I hope this helps!
