Integrating Rust with Node.js can be beneficial for handling CPU-bound tasks, which are tasks that require a lot of computational power and can block the Node.js event loop, reducing performance. Rust is a systems programming language known for its speed and concurrency capabilities, making it a good choice for CPU-bound tasks [Source 1](https://blog.logrocket.com/improving-node-js-performing-rust/).

To integrate Rust with Node.js, you can use libraries such as Neon or N-API, which provide a way to write native Node.js modules in Rust. These libraries provide a bridge between Node.js and Rust, allowing you to call Rust functions from JavaScript code.

- **Neon**: It's a library that allows you to write fast, safe native Node.js modules in Rust. It provides a high-level API for interacting with JavaScript from Rust and is mainly used for CPU-intensive tasks [Source 17](https://blog.logrocket.com/writing-rust-bindings-node-js-neon/).

- **N-API**: It's an API for building native Addons. It's independent from the underlying JavaScript runtime (ex V8) and is maintained as part of Node.js itself. This API isn't directly related to Rust, but there are libraries like `nodejs-sys` and `nodejs-rs` that provide Rust bindings for N-API [Source 1](https://blog.logrocket.com/improving-node-js-performing-rust/).

Here's an example of how you could create a function in Rust using Neon and then call it from Node.js:

```rust
// lib.rs
#[macro_use]
extern crate neon;

use neon::prelude::*;

fn hello_world(mut cx: FunctionContext) -> JsResult<JsString> {
    Ok(cx.string("Hello, world!"))
}

register_module!(mut cx, {
    cx.export_function("helloWorld", hello_world)
});
```

```javascript
// index.js
const addon = require('../native');
console.log(addon.helloWorld());
```

In this example, we're defining a `helloWorld` function in Rust that returns a string, and then we're calling this function from JavaScript [Source 17](https://blog.logrocket.com/writing-rust-bindings-node-js-neon/).

The benefit of this approach is that you can offload CPU-intensive tasks to Rust, which can handle these tasks more efficiently than JavaScript, improving the performance of your Node.js application. However, integrating Rust with Node.js can add complexity to your project, and it may not be necessary if your application doesn't perform many CPU-intensive tasks.

As for Python, you can also call Python functions from Node.js using libraries like `python-shell`, but the integration is not as seamless as with Rust, and Python doesn't provide the same performance benefits as Rust for CPU-bound tasks [Source 26](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/getting-started-with-rust-function/).
