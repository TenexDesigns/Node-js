What is a CPU-heavy task?
A CPU-heavy task is one that requires a lot of processing power from your CPU. These are typically tasks that involve lots of complex calculations or tasks that have a lot of elements that need to be dealt with simultaneously, increasing how hard your processor has to work. 


CPU OPREATIONS
  Gaming. Games in the RTS, open-world, and simulation genre, or games that incorporate realistic physics are often quite CPU-heavy. 
Streaming. Streaming by itself isn’t too demanding, but the fact is that most streams involve gameplay as well, so the two have to be dealt with simultaneously. 
Video editing. Video editing is a computationally demanding process that requires your CPU to deal with encoding and decoding, compression and uncompressing, and transferring video files in real-time. 
Video rendering. High-quality renders can take a long time. Days, even weeks – and that too on the very strongest consumer-grade processors available today. 
Scientific applications. Running complex simulations or working with AI and ML applications can be quite CPU-intensive, as you would expect. 



  I/O OPERTIONS
  any operation, program or device that transfers data to or from a computer. Common I/O devices include printers, hard disks, keyboards and mice.

      
    I/O Device Examples
    Keyboard Input: When a user enters data into a system using a keyboard.
    Mouse Input: When a user interacts with a system through a mouse.
    Touchscreen Input: When a user interacts with a system by touching the screen.
    Voice Input: When a user speaks into a system to enter data or perform an action.

**CPU Operations vs. I/O Operations:**

**CPU Operations:**
- CPU operations are tasks that require computational processing by the CPU, such as calculations, data manipulation, and algorithmic tasks.
- These operations are typically CPU-bound, meaning they heavily rely on the processing power of the CPU.
- Examples include mathematical computations, sorting algorithms, and complex data transformations.

**I/O Operations:**
- I/O (Input/Output) operations involve interactions with external resources, like reading from or writing to files, making network requests, or querying a database.
- These operations are often slower and can result in the program waiting for external systems to respond, making them I/O-bound.
- Examples include reading a file, making an HTTP request, or querying a database.

**Implementing CPU and I/O Operations in Node.js:**

**CPU Operation Example:**
```javascript
// CPU-bound operation example: Fibonacci sequence calculation
const fibonacci = (n) => {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
};

// Perform CPU-bound operation
const result = fibonacci(40);
console.log(result);
```

In this example, calculating the Fibonacci sequence is a CPU-intensive task. The function `fibonacci` recursively calculates Fibonacci numbers and is a good representation of a CPU-bound operation.

**I/O Operation Example:**
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

// I/O-bound operation example: Reading a file
fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});
```

Here, reading a file using `fs.readFile` is an example of an I/O-bound operation. The program initiates the read operation and continues with other tasks while waiting for the file read to complete. The callback handles the result when the operation finishes.

**Combining CPU and I/O Operations:**
```javascript
// Combining CPU and I/O operations
const performTasks = () => {
  // CPU-bound operation
  const result = fibonacci(35);
  console.log('CPU Operation Result:', result);

  // I/O-bound operation
  fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      return;
    }
    console.log('I/O Operation Result:', data);
  });
};

performTasks();
```

In a real-world scenario, a Node.js application often needs to handle both CPU-bound and I/O-bound operations. In this example, `performTasks` combines a CPU-bound operation (Fibonacci calculation) with an I/O-bound operation (reading a file).

Node.js excels at managing such scenarios by utilizing its event loop, non-blocking I/O, and asynchronous programming features. While one operation is in progress, the event loop can switch to handle another, ensuring efficient resource utilization even in the presence of both CPU and I/O operations.
