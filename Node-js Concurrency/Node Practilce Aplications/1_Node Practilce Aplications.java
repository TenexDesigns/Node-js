**Problems Solved by Node.js:**

1. **Scalability:**
   - **Problem:** Traditional web servers create a new thread or process for each incoming request, which can lead to high memory usage and reduced scalability.
   - **Solution with Node.js:**
     - Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model with a single-threaded event loop, making it highly scalable.
     - Code Sample:
     ```javascript
     const http = require('http');

     const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
       res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
       res.end('Hello, World!\n');
     });

     server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
       console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
     });
     ```

2. **Handling Concurrent Connections:**
   - **Problem:** Traditional server models struggle with handling a large number of concurrent connections.
   - **Solution with Node.js:**
     - Node.js efficiently handles thousands of concurrent connections by employing an event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O.
     - Code Sample:
     ```javascript
     const http = require('http');

     const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
       res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
       res.end('Hello, World!\n');
     });

     server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
       console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
     });
     ```

3. **Real-time Applications:**
   - **Problem:** Traditional web servers struggle with real-time applications like chat applications or online gaming.
   - **Solution with Node.js:**
     - Node.js excels at building real-time applications with features like WebSockets, allowing bidirectional communication between the client and server.
     - Code Sample (WebSocket with `ws` library):
     ```javascript
     const WebSocket = require('ws');
     const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });

     wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
       ws.on('message', (message) => {
         console.log(`Received: ${message}`);
       });

       ws.send('Hello, Client!');
     });
     ```

4. **Single Programming Language:**
   - **Problem:** Using different languages for server-side and client-side development can introduce complexity and increase the learning curve.
   - **Solution with Node.js:**
     - Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript for both server-side and client-side development, promoting a unified development experience.
     - Code Sample:
     ```javascript
     // Server-side
     const http = require('http');

     const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
       res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
       res.end('Hello, World!\n');
     });

     server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
       console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
     });

     // Client-side
     // JavaScript code running in a web browser
     ```

5. **Development Speed:**
   - **Problem:** Traditional server setups often require compilation and restart for code changes, slowing down the development process.
   - **Solution with Node.js:**
     - Node.js provides a fast development cycle with the ability to restart the server automatically upon code changes using tools like `nodemon`.
     - Code Sample:
     ```bash
     npm install -g nodemon
     nodemon server.js
     ```

Node.js addresses these challenges by leveraging its event-driven, non-blocking architecture and providing a simple and consistent programming model for building scalable and real-time applications.
