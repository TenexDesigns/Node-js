This article provides a comprehensive explanation of non-blocking or asynchronous I/O in Node.js and highlights its advantages over traditional synchronous I/O methods.

**Key Points Discussed:**

1. **Single-Threaded Nature of JavaScript:** JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning it can execute only one piece of code at a time. This poses a challenge for handling I/O operations, which are often slow and can block the main thread.

2. **Synchronous I/O Limitations:** Synchronous I/O requires the program to wait for the I/O operation to complete before continuing, leading to idle CPU and limited throughput.

3. **Asynchronous I/O Concept:** Asynchronous I/O allows the program to initiate an I/O operation and continue executing other tasks while the I/O completes. This ensures efficient CPU utilization and improved performance.

4. **Promise-Based Asynchronous I/O:** Modern Node.js utilizes Promises to handle asynchronous I/O. Promises allow the program to define callbacks that will be executed when the I/O operation completes.

5. **Async Functions and await Keyword:** The `async` function and `await` keyword provide a more concise and readable way to handle asynchronous I/O, making the code flow more natural.

6. **Benefits of Asynchronous I/O:** Asynchronous I/O in Node.js offers several advantages:

    - Improved Scalability: Node.js can handle a large number of concurrent requests due to its non-blocking I/O model.

    - Enhanced Performance: Asynchronous I/O keeps the CPU busy and utilizes various I/O subsystems efficiently.

    - Easier Error Handling: Promises provide a structured way to handle errors in asynchronous operations.

7. **Comparison with Multithreading:** While multithreading allows concurrent execution of tasks, it introduces complexity in synchronization and resource management. Asynchronous I/O in Node.js provides a simpler and more scalable approach for handling I/O-intensive workloads.

8. **Limited CPU Utilization:** Node.js, by default, utilizes a single CPU core, even with asynchronous I/O. However, multiple Node.js processes can be run on different CPU cores to maximize CPU utilization.

9. **Alternative Asynchronous I/O Mechanisms:** Other languages like Java and C++ also provide asynchronous I/O mechanisms, but they are often more complex to implement compared to Node.js's Promise-based approach.

10. **Application Suitability:** Asynchronous I/O is particularly well-suited for I/O-intensive applications, such as web servers and network-based applications.

In summary, asynchronous I/O plays a crucial role in Node.js's ability to handle a high volume of concurrent requests efficiently and performantly. Its non-blocking nature and Promise-based approach make it a powerful tool for building scalable and responsive applications.

Javascript is single-threaded. (We’ll ignore the use of workers, which are separated =).

That means, it is only executing one piece of code at a time.

IO doesn’t happen immediately. If you had to wait every time you did some IO, your program will be limited in how much work it can do, by the time spent waiting for IO. The CPU will sit idle while you wait.

So, a web server could handle only a single request at a time, and you’d have to wait until all the IO for that request was completed before the web server could respond to another request.

Asynchronous IO is IO where you request the IO, and then pick up the results of the IO later. In the meantime, you can proceed to do other work, keeping the CPU working for you, and do other IO, keeping the various IO subsystems working, and greatly increasing throughput.

In modern Node.js, you should use the versions that return a Promise. Once the IO completes, any code that waits on that promise can pick up the result and use it. You can use this with the .then(fn) method on a Promise, but the preferred way is to use async function and the await operation.

Older Node.js code used callback functions, which were called when the IO was done and Javascript wasn’t otherwise busy. This was substantially more more awkward and bug-prone, as it forced you to break up your code in unnatural ways.

In Node.js, some, but not all, IO operations have synchronous versions. These are only appropriate in limited case, such as a one-off bit of code to perform some task, or to do a one-time loading of info during startup. Even then, with the use of async function, the benefit of using synchronous IO is limited; you write almost the same code, just adding ‘await’.

Asynchronous IO is not new to Node.JS. In operating systems in the 60’s and 70’s, long before multithreaded user programs, if often took the form of completion flags that the usermode program had to check. Sometimes the OS would set up DMA transfers to hardware devices that would mark individual buffers as completed and ready for reuse, or provide an updated counter indicating progress of the transfer.

Interrupt routines were another approach, normal at the OS level, but sometimes reflected as usermode interrupts.

Callback routines (aka completion routines) were a later innovation that built on this to allow registering an individual routine to call (often registered with one supplied “context” argument, because most languages did not have closures back then).

Promises build on that to allow multiple and entire chains of execution predicated on the successful (or unsuccessful) completion of the IO.

Async functions then simplify that, based on generators, to allow execution of linear code to be resumed on completion of a promise. This allows code using asynchronous IO in Node.js (and Javascript in browsers and other contexts) to be written in nearly the same way as synchronous.

In many other languages, asynchronous IO is not heavily used, instead relying on multiple threads for parallelism. However, threads are a finite resource, requiring considerable stack space, OS resources, etc. So IO in Node.js scales differently, allowing a Node.js server to serve a very large number of IO-intensive requests simultaneously.

It is, however, aside from the new Workers facility, limited to a single thread of execution, meaning it cannot take advantage of multiple CPUs in a single Node.js process. You can, however, utilize multiple Node.js processes to utilize multiple CPUs. Between this and Workers, it covers the majority of server workloads.

In languages like Java or C++, asynchronous IO is available, but considerably harder to make use of. For many workloads, threads are more than adequate, with no clear advantage to asynchronous or synchronous.

However, inter-task synchronization is more complex in a threaded environment. In Javavscript, you know a variable will not have its value changed by another thread between any two points in a function (or between ‘await’ keywords in an async function). In multi-threaded environments, you need locking or other interventions to ensure this. On the other hand, it gives you more control, including (since a server can use threads to use all CPUs instead of separate processes) allowing easier inter-task communication. So you probably won’t see any pure Javascript database servers.
