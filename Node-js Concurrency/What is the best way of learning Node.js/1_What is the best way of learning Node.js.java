  I’ll skip the obvious first step which I assume you already know: Learn to program. I’ll assume you already know how to do this. If not, then that should be where you start and that’s a whole different question.

Learn JavaScript. Learn it well. You’ll need to know all the aspects of the language including things like Promises, generators, rest/spread, destructuring, Proxy/Reflect, Arrow functions, class, and so on.
You’re done.
Seriously. node.js is just JavaScript with some different libraries than what you might be used to from the browser. You no longer have any of the browser APIs and your only way to display anything to the user or get input is to use stdout and stdin or their wrappers, the console functions.

To make up for the loss of these libraries, you are handed a bunch of new ones. These libraries are more or less what you’ll find in most other languages: file system access, network interface, encryption, and so on.

You can find all the libraries along with the documentation here: Node.js Documentation

In addition, you have access to almost 530,000 modules here: npm

And that is your very best resource. Not just for modules, but more importantly, for learning how to write JavaScript in a node.js context. Now, what follows for the rest of this paragraph is my opinion and may, or may not, be factually correct. It’s certainly true for me. Here goes: Books are useful and worthwhile for a general idea of how to do something. Courses are much the same, useful but they won’t really teach you how to program node.js (or anything else). The very best way to learn is a combination of actually writing code and reading other people’s code. Start by reading some modules. Get an idea of how they are organized. They are all npm modules. They all have a package.json file. What is that? How do you start to make a node.js project? Those questions are easily answered using a book or course, or a simple google search. Or I could just show you:

mkdir my-project 
cd my-project 
npm init 
There. That’s it.

Nothing will teach you various ways of doing things better than other people’s code, especially doing things in better ways than you first thought of. Maybe doing things you didn’t think of at all. Who knows? Read some small modules. Try out some things. Read some bigger modules. Try some more things. Read code, write code. Rinse and repeat. Keep doing this until you die from old age. Yep. Sorry about that, but the learning process never ends. Especially in programming.

node.js is easy because there are few requirements to get started and no more requirements to get good or even great. JavaScript is fast and very flexible, allowing you write things in a style that suits you. With JavaScript and node.js you only need one language for the front-end and back-end. If you know one then you already know most of what you need for the other.

Same language, just difference ecosystem.

To sum up, there are only two steps (provided you already know JavaScript): Read code, write code. In parallel.

If you don’t know JavaScript but you know some other language, then these instructions work just as well. If you don’t know programming at all, then come back to this answer after you learn.

Some things that will help you:

Stay away from frameworks while you’re learning.
Stay away from frameworks. They are heavy and hide the basic functionality that you’re trying to learn.
Get a good IDE. I use WebStorm which is awesome (apart from a couple minor issues) but there are others that work well.
Knowing some basic bash shell commands and very basic bash scripting will be very helpful.
Know basic networking protocols and, at least, very basic networking in general.
Remember: JavaScript is single-threaded, run-to-completion and any semblance you see that looks like multi-tasking really isn’t. node.js uses libuv to schedule event handlers and whatnot, but this is never pre-emptive.
Don’t buy into JavaScript ideologies. There are lots of them out there: classes are bad, functional programming is great, comma-first var declarations, one true brace, “standard” style, and so on. Ignore them. Find your own style and then see what you want to adopt or not. Make choices from knowledge, not ignorance.
Don’t get discouraged. There are about a gazillion people ready to help you and answer your questions, many of them right here on Quora. First, try to figure out the answer on your own but don’t spend too much time on it but do try very hard. If it takes too long, ask. But always make the effort to solve it yourself at first. You’re trying to learn, not just solve a problem. By the way, this remains true for all time and all things. :)
Work on Linux (real men) or Mac (lesser men). If you’re on a Windows box (least men), make sure you install the Bash on Ubuntu on Windows, a real linux/bash in Windows native. And free. [Full disclosure: I’m writing this answer on a Windows box. ;p ]
Read code/Write code. There really is no better way to learn how to code or to learn a language than to read real code doing real things. You don’t need to understand everything, just enough to learn something new.
I’m sure I could think of tens of things to add but this post is long enough.

Best of luck.

Don’t forget to ask questions.
