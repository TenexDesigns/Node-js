Node.js is built on top of Google Chromes V8 JavaScript engine, which powers in-browser applications
like Gmail freecodecamp.org. It uses libuv under the hood to handle asynchronous events, providing 
an abstraction layer for network and file system functionality on both Windows and POSIX-based systems
en.wikipedia.org. Node.js also includes the zlib library for compression and decompression,
  and the crypto library for cryptographic operations.

1.JS Library: Node.js includes a rich library of various JavaScript modules that simplify
the development of web applications tutorialspoint.com. These modules can be used for tasks
such as file system operations, HTTP requests, and more.

2.C/C++ Features: Node.js allows developers to create "add-ons" using a C-based API called N-API,
which can produce loadable .node modules from source code written in C/C++ en.wikipedia.org. 
This can be used to enhance capabilities and improve the performance of applications.

MORE EXPLANATION
*******************************************************************************************************************************8

Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to 
build scalable network applications. Under the hood, Node.js comprises several important
features and dependencies that enable its functionality. Lets explore each of these features in more detail:

JS Library:
Node.js is primarily built upon the JavaScript language, leveraging its syntax, data structures,
and functionality. As a JavaScript runtime, Node.js allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server-side.

C/C++ Features:
Node.js combines the power of JavaScript with C/C++ libraries and features to provide low-level system access and 
performance optimizations. This integration allows developers to utilize C/C++ bindings within their
JavaScript applications when necessary for tasks that require system-level interactions.

Dependencies:
Node.js relies on various dependencies to provide core functionality. Some essential dependencies are:

(a) V8 Engine:
The V8 engine is developed by Google and is at the heart of Node.js.
It is responsible for executing JavaScript code and provides high-performance,
  just-in-time (JIT) compilation to optimize the execution speed of JavaScript.

(b) libuv:
Libuv is a multi-platform support library that abstracts the underlying systems I/O operations,
such as file system access, networking, and concurrency. It enables Node.js to handle asynchronous
operations efficiently by utilizing event loops and providing an event-driven programming model.

(c) zlib:
Zlib is a compression library that allows Node.js applications to perform data compression and decompression.
It supports various compression algorithms such as gzip and deflate, enabling developers to work with compressed data efficiently.

(d) crypto:
The crypto module in Node.js provides cryptographic functionality
  , including secure hash algorithms, encryption, and decryption. 
  Developers can use this module to implement secure communication protocols,
    handle passwords, and perform data encryption operations.

Additional Important Features in Node.js:

NPM (Node Package Manager):
Node.js comes with NPM, a powerful package manager that allows developers to install,
  manage, and share reusable packages/modules from the vast NPM registry.
  It simplifies dependency management and enhances code reuse and collaboration in the Node.js ecosystem.

Asynchronous Programming:
Node.js utilizes an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, enabling asynchronous programming.
This approach allows multiple I/O operations to run concurrently without blocking the execution,
  resulting in better scalability and performance for network applications.

Single-Threaded Event Loop:
Node.js follows a single-threaded event loop architecture,
  where a single thread handles multiple concurrent connections and I/O operations.
  This design choice simplifies programming by avoiding the complexities of managing threads directly,
    while still achieving high scalability and performance.

Cross-Platform Compatibility:
Node.js is designed to be cross-platform, meaning it runs on various operating systems,
  including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This portability allows developers to write code once and deploy
  it across different environments.

These features and dependencies collectively make Node.js a powerful and versatile platform for 
  building server-side applications, microservices, APIs, real-time applications, and more.
