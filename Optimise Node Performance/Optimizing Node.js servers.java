Optimizing Node.js servers and backend performance can be achieved through various strategies. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Use the latest release of Node.js:** Always use the latest release of Node.js to get the best possible performance [Source 0](https://blog.appsignal.com/2021/11/24/7-ways-to-improve-nodejs-performance-at-scale.html).

2. **Choose the most performant libraries:** Pay attention to your dependencies, and choose the most performant libraries where possible. Sometimes, it is better to forgo adding a dependency and instead write the code to perform a task yourself [Source 0](https://blog.appsignal.com/2021/11/24/7-ways-to-improve-nodejs-performance-at-scale.html).

3. **Use asynchronous programming:** Ensure that all independent I/O operations use asynchronous primitives like callbacks, promises, and async/await to ensure a non-blocking operation flow and improve downstream latency [Source 3](https://raygun.com/blog/improve-node-performance/).

4. **Optimize database queries:** Optimize your database queries, and scale them appropriately to ensure that they do not become a bottleneck [Source 0](https://blog.appsignal.com/2021/11/24/7-ways-to-improve-nodejs-performance-at-scale.html).

5. **Use Node.js streams for large data:** When working with large pieces of data, use Node.js streams for optimal memory efficiency and reduced latency [Source 0](https://blog.appsignal.com/2021/11/24/7-ways-to-improve-nodejs-performance-at-scale.html).

6. **Avoid memory allocations in hotspots:** To reduce the load on the garbage collector (thus reducing latency), avoid memory allocations in hotspots [Source 0](https://blog.appsignal.com/2021/11/24/7-ways-to-improve-nodejs-performance-at-scale.html).

7. **Use a load balancer:** Using a load balancer can help distribute network traffic across multiple servers to ensure that no single server becomes a bottleneck [Source 1](https://blog.logrocket.com/7-ways-to-improve-node-js-performance-at-scale/).

8. **Use caching:** Caching can significantly improve the performance of your application by storing the result of expensive operations and reusing them when the same operation is performed again [Source 1](https://blog.logrocket.com/7-ways-to-improve-node-js-performance-at-scale/).

9. **Monitor your application:** Use a monitoring solution to track the performance of your application and identify any bottlenecks or issues [Source 0](https://blog.appsignal.com/2021/11/24/7-ways-to-improve-nodejs-performance-at-scale.html).
