In Node.js, pipes are a powerful feature provided by the built-in stream module for handling data flow between
different data sources and destinations. Pipes allow you to connect readable and writable streams together, 
automatically managing the flow of data from the source to the destination. Heres an overview of how pipes work in Node.js:

Readable Streams:
Readable streams represent a source of data that can be read sequentially. Examples include reading data from a file,
receiving data from an HTTP request, or generating data dynamically. Readable streams emit the data event when new
data is available to be read.

Writable Streams:
Writable streams represent a destination where data can be written. Examples include writing data to a file, 
sending data over an HTTP response, or processing data in some way. Writable streams provide a write() method to 
accept data and an end() method to indicate the completion of writing.

Piping Streams:
The pipe() method is used to connect a readable stream to a writable stream. It sets up the flow of data from the
source to the destination automatically. Data from the readable stream is piped to the writable stream, 
and the writable stream handles writing it to the destination.


const readableStream = getReadableStreamSomehow();
const writableStream = getWritableStreamSomehow();

readableStream.pipe(writableStream);
In this example, the pipe() method is used to pipe data from the readableStream to the writableStream. 
The data is transferred from the source to the destination in chunks, without the need for explicit handling.

Transform Streams:
Transform streams are a type of duplex stream that can modify or transform data as it passes through.
They inherit from both readable and writable streams, allowing you to modify the data during the piping process. 
Examples include compressing data, encrypting data, or parsing data in a specific format.


const { Transform } = require('stream');

const myTransformStream = new Transform({
  transform(chunk, encoding, callback) {
    // Modify or transform the chunk of data
    const transformedData = modifyDataSomehow(chunk);

    // Push the transformed data to the readable side
    this.push(transformedData);

    // Indicate that the transformation is complete
    callback();
  }
});
In this example, a custom transform stream is created by extending the Transform class. 
The transform() method is overridden to modify the incoming data chunk and push the transformed data to the readable side.

Pipes provide a simple and efficient way to handle data flow in Node.js applications.
They allow you to connect different streams together, including readable, writable, 
and transform streams, enabling seamless data processing and transferring.
By utilizing pipes, you can avoid manual handling of data chunks and achieve more modular and maintainable code.
