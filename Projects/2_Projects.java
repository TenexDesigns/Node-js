Node.js is a popular open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. Node.js is built on top of Google's V8 JavaScript engine and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js is particularly useful for building real-time applications that require high concurrency and low latency.

Here are some practical projects that you can build using Node.js:

1. **Real-time chat application**: Build a real-time chat application using Node.js and Socket.IO. This project will help you understand how to use Node.js to build real-time applications that require high concurrency and low latency.

2. **Weather app**: Build a weather application that displays the current weather conditions for a given location. This project will help you understand how to use Node.js to make API requests and parse JSON data.

3. **Todo list**: Build a simple todo list application using Node.js and MongoDB. This project will help you understand how to use Node.js to build a RESTful API and interact with a database.

4. **E-commerce site**: Build an e-commerce site using Node.js and Express.js. This project will help you understand how to use Node.js to build a web application that handles user authentication, shopping cart functionality, and payment processing.

5. **Blog**: Build a blog using Node.js and Express.js. This project will help you understand how to use Node.js to build a web application that handles user authentication, blog post creation, and commenting functionality.

Here are some resources that you can use to become better at Node.js:

1. **Official Node.js documentation**: The official Node.js documentation is a great resource for learning about Node.js. It provides detailed information about the Node.js runtime, APIs, and modules.

2. **FreeCodeCamp**: FreeCodeCamp offers a free Node.js course that covers the basics of Node.js and Express.js. The course includes video tutorials, written tutorials, and coding exercises.

3. **NodeSchool**: NodeSchool offers interactive lessons that teach you how to use Node.js. The lessons cover a wide range of topics, from the basics of Node.js to more advanced topics like streams and buffers.

4. **Mastering Node.js**: Mastering Node.js is a book that covers advanced topics in Node.js, such as streams, clusters, and child processes. The book is available for purchase on Amazon.

5. **Node.js Recipes**: Node.js Recipes is a collection of recipes that cover a wide range of topics in Node.js. The recipes are available for free on GitHub.
