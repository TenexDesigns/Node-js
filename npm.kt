What is NPM

Npm - Is the worlds largest software library  (registry)
It is a software package manager



1. NPM is a Software Library
If you think of a library, - It contains  books written by diiferen authores
A book library contains books written by diffrent authores


Simialry   - Npm is a libry or registry which contains packages written by various developers


It is a large public database of javascript code tht developers from all over the world can use to share and borrow code.
If you author a "code packaage", you can publish it to the npm registry for others to use

On the other hand, if you come across a code package that is authored by someone else and solves the problem you have at hand, you can  brooorw that code without having to reinvent the wheel




2. Npm is a software package Manage
But --->
  
how does a developer publish a package to the registry

how does a developer consume a package from the registry

what happens if the package author decides to change a function name in a package

how would a consumer of that package update an already installed package

what if the package I am consuming is dependent on another package


----------------
as you can see managing packages in a project is not as simple as it sounds


this is where npm as a package manager comes to the rescue ,
we have access to a command line interface tool that lets us install and manage packages in a project
