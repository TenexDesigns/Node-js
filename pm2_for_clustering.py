Use code with caution. Learn more
Once you have installed PM2, you can then start a Node.js application by running the following command:

Code snippet
pm2 start my-app.js
Use code with caution. Learn more
PM2 will start the application and monitor it for errors. If the application crashes, PM2 will automatically restart it.

You can also use PM2 to start multiple instances of an application. To do this, you can use the -i option. For example, the following command will start two instances of the my-app.js application:

Code snippet
pm2 start -i 2 my-app.js
Use code with caution. Learn more
PM2 also provides a number of other features, such as:

Automatic reloading of applications when code changes.
Load balancing of applications across multiple instances.
Logging of application events.
Monitoring of application performance.
Benefits of using PM2

There are a number of benefits to using PM2, including:

Ease of use: PM2 is very easy to use. You can start, stop, restart, and monitor Node.js applications with a single command.
Features: PM2 provides a number of features that can be used to improve the performance and reliability of Node.js applications.
Community: PM2 has a large and active community. There are a number of resources available to help you learn how to use PM2 and troubleshoot problems.
Conclusion

PM2 is a powerful tool that can be used to manage Node.js applications. If you are looking for a way to improve the performance and reliability of your Node.js applications, PM2 is a great option.

PM2 (Process Manager 2) is a production-ready process manager for Node.js applications. It provides a robust set of features to streamline the deployment, management, and monitoring of Node.js processes in production environments. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use PM2:

Install PM2:

Install PM2 globally by running the following command:
Copy code
npm install -g pm2
Start your application with PM2:

Navigate to your application directory in the terminal.
Start your Node.js application with PM2 using the following command:
sql
Copy code
pm2 start app.js
Replace app.js with the entry point file of your application.
Process management with PM2:

PM2 offers several commands to manage your application processes:
pm2 list: Lists all running processes managed by PM2.
pm2 stop <app-name|id>: Stops a specific application or process.
pm2 restart <app-name|id>: Restarts a specific application or process.
pm2 delete <app-name|id>: Deletes a specific application or process from PM2.
pm2 logs: Displays logs for all processes managed by PM2.
pm2 monit: Monitors CPU, memory, and other statistics of running processes.
Configuration using ecosystem file:

PM2 uses an ecosystem file (ecosystem.config.js) to define the configuration for your Node.js applications.

Create an ecosystem.config.js file in your application's directory and specify the configuration options.

Here's an example of an ecosystem file:

javascript
Copy code
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'my-app',
      script: 'app.js',
      instances: 'max',
      autorestart: true,
      watch: false,
      max_memory_restart: '1G',
      env: {
        NODE_ENV: 'production',
      },
    },
  ],
};
The ecosystem file allows you to configure options such as the application name, entry point, number of instances, environment variables, and more.

Managing application processes with the ecosystem file:

To start an application defined in the ecosystem file, use the following command:
arduino
Copy code
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
PM2 will read the configuration from the ecosystem.config.js file and start the application accordingly.
You can use the same PM2 commands mentioned earlier to manage the processes defined in the ecosystem file.
Monitoring and scaling:

PM2 provides monitoring capabilities to monitor the health and performance of your Node.js processes.
Use the pm2 monit command to launch a monitoring dashboard that displays CPU, memory, and other metrics.
PM2 supports horizontal scaling by allowing you to increase or decrease the number of instances for your application.
PM2 simplifies the process management and monitoring of Node.js applications, making it easier to deploy and manage applications in production environments. It offers features such as process management, log management, ecosystem configuration, and monitoring. By using PM2, you can ensure high availability, performance, and ease of maintenance for your Node.js applications.
